# CRITICAL FIX v3.0.9 - Defensive CRLF Stripping

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Issue**: CRLF line endings persisting despite bundle-time normalization
**Root Cause**: Files acquiring CRLF during SCP transfer or tar extraction on server

---

## Problem Analysis

### What Happened

After v3.0.8 deployed with line ending fixes in the bundle creation script, the **SAME error still occurred**:

```
[ERROR] Expected one of [ \t\r\n], "#", ... at line 61, column 108 (byte 2261)
if [user_agent.original] =~ /curl|wget|python|...|acunetix/
                                                          ^ Missing /i {
```

### Investigation Results

**Local Files** (Windows):
```bash
$ file d:/RedELK/elkserver/logstash/conf.d/20-filter-redir-apache.conf
ASCII text  ← Unix LF ✓

$ file DEPLOYMENT-BUNDLE/20-filter-redir-apache.conf
ASCII text  ← Unix LF ✓
```

**Deployed Files** (Server):
```bash
$ docker logs redelk-logstash
[ERROR] ... byte 2261 ... /acunetix/  ← Truncated, missing /i {
```

**Conclusion**: Files are correct in the bundle, but **CRLF is being re-introduced** during:
- SCP transfer from Windows → Linux
- Tar extraction on the server
- File system operations on the server

## The Fix: Defense in Depth

### Strategy

Since CRLF can be introduced at multiple points in the workflow, we now **strip CRLF at EVERY file copy operation** during deployment:

### 1. Bundle Creation (Already Fixed in v3.0.8)

[create-bundle.sh](d:\RedELK\create-bundle.sh) already normalizes line endings when creating the bundle.

### 2. First Copy (Bundle → conf.d/) - NEW FIX

[redelk_ubuntu_deploy.sh:512-516](d:\RedELK\redelk_ubuntu_deploy.sh#L512-L516)

**Before**:
```bash
cp "$conf" "${REDELK_PATH}/elkserver/logstash/conf.d/"
```

**After**:
```bash
# CRITICAL: Strip CRLF line endings for Docker/Linux compatibility
sed 's/\r$//' "$conf" > "${REDELK_PATH}/elkserver/logstash/conf.d/${filename}"
```

### 3. Second Copy (conf.d/ → pipelines/) - NEW FIX

[redelk_ubuntu_deploy.sh:1627-1631](d:\RedELK\redelk_ubuntu_deploy.sh#L1627-L1631)

**Before**:
```bash
cp "$conf" "${REDELK_PATH}/elkserver/logstash/pipelines/"
```

**After**:
```bash
# CRITICAL: Strip any CRLF that might have been introduced during file transfer
sed 's/\r$//' "$conf" > "${REDELK_PATH}/elkserver/logstash/pipelines/${filename}"
```

### 4. Diagnostic Output - NEW

After each copy stage, the script now:
- Checks line endings with `file` command
- Shows hex dump of bytes around position 2261
- Warns if CRLF detected

[redelk_ubuntu_deploy.sh:535-541](d:\RedELK\redelk_ubuntu_deploy.sh#L535-L541)
```bash
echo "[DEBUG] Checking line endings on 20-filter-redir-apache.conf:"
file "${REDELK_PATH}/elkserver/logstash/conf.d/20-filter-redir-apache.conf" | grep -q "CRLF" && \
    echo "  ⚠ WARNING: File still has CRLF line endings!" || \
    echo "  ✓ File has Unix LF line endings"
```

---

## Why This Approach Works

### Defense in Depth Layers

1. **Bundle Creation**: Normalize line endings when packaging (v3.0.8)
2. **First Deployment Copy**: Strip CRLF when copying from bundle to conf.d/ (v3.0.9)
3. **Second Deployment Copy**: Strip CRLF when copying from conf.d/ to pipelines/ (v3.0.9)
4. **Validation**: Check and report line endings after each copy (v3.0.9)

### Why `sed` Instead of `cp`

Using `sed 's/\r$//'` to copy files ensures that:
- CRLF characters are stripped during the copy operation
- The output file is guaranteed to have Unix LF line endings
- No separate cleanup step is needed
- Works regardless of how CRLF was introduced

## Expected Deployment Output (New)

With the diagnostic output added, you'll now see:

```
⚙️  Logstash Pipeline Configs (CRITICAL)
  ✓ 10-input-filebeat.conf
  ✓ 20-filter-redir-apache.conf
  ...
  → Copied 11 config(s) to: elkserver/logstash/conf.d/
  ✓ Verified: 11 configs in place

[DEBUG] Checking line endings on 20-filter-redir-apache.conf:
  ✓ File has Unix LF line endings  ← SHOULD SEE THIS

───────────────────────────────────────────────────

📄 Deploying Logstash Pipeline Configurations
  📄 Deploying: 10-input-filebeat.conf
  📄 Deploying: 20-filter-redir-apache.conf
  ...
  ✓ Deployed 11 pipeline configuration files
  ✓ Verified: Logstash will load 11 config files

[DEBUG] Checking line endings on final deployed config:
  ✓ File has Unix LF line endings  ← SHOULD SEE THIS

[DEBUG] Hex dump of bytes 2255-2270 (around byte 2261):

       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Should end with /i {
```

---

## Validation

### Before Deployment

**Logstash validation should now PASS**:
```
[INFO] Running: docker run --rm -v pipeline:...

[SUCCESS] ✓ Logstash configuration validation PASSED
Configuration OK - All pipeline files are syntactically correct
```

### During Deployment

**Logstash should start successfully**:
```
[INFO] Monitoring Logstash startup (verbose mode)...
[2025-10-28T...] Starting Logstash
[2025-10-28T...] Pipeline started successfully
[2025-10-28T...] Starting server on port: 5044  ← SUCCESS!
```

## If Issues STILL Persist

### Additional Diagnostics

If CRLF issues continue after this fix, run these commands on the server:

```bash
# Check source bundle file
cd /tmp/DEPLOYMENT-BUNDLE
file 20-filter-redir-apache.conf
# Should show: ASCII text (NO "CRLF")

# Check after first copy (conf.d/)
file /opt/RedELK/elkserver/logstash/conf.d/20-filter-redir-apache.conf
# Should show: ASCII text (NO "CRLF")

# Check after second copy (pipelines/)
file /opt/RedELK/elkserver/logstash/pipelines/20-filter-redir-apache.conf
# Should show: ASCII text (NO "CRLF")

# Check hex dump at problematic position
head -c 2270 /opt/RedELK/elkserver/logstash/pipelines/20-filter-redir-apache.conf | tail -c 20 | od -A x -t x1z
# Should show: ...61 63 75 6e 65 74 69 78 2f 69 20 7b  |acunetix/i {|
#                                                  ^^   ^^ ^^
#                                                  /    i  space {
```

### Potential Additional Issues

If line endings are correct but error persists:
1. **Docker volume mount issues**: Check if Docker on Windows is corrupting files during bind mount
2. **Git autocrlf**: Check if Git is converting files during clone/pull
3. **Text editor**: Ensure your editor isn't saving with CRLF

## Version History

### v3.0.9 (2025-10-28) - CURRENT
- **NEW**: Defensive CRLF stripping at BOTH copy stages during deployment
- **NEW**: Diagnostic output showing line endings after each copy
- **NEW**: Hex dump of problematic bytes for debugging
- Guarantees Unix LF line endings regardless of transfer method

### v3.0.8 (2025-10-28)
- CRLF normalization in bundle creation
- ERR trap handling fix
- Real-time Logstash logging
- **Issue**: CRLF reintroduced during deployment on server

### v3.0.1 - v3.0.7
- Various deployment script fixes
- SCRIPT_DIR resolution, cleanup, arithmetic, traps, etc.

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Diagnostic output shows "File has Unix LF line endings" at BOTH checkpoints
✅ Hex dump shows `/i {` (bytes: 2f 69 20 7b) at position 2261
✅ Logstash validation PASSES without regex parsing errors
✅ Logstash starts successfully and binds to port 5044
✅ Post-flight checks pass (5+/6)

## Technical Notes

### Why CRLF Breaks Logstash

Logstash's config parser treats `\r` (carriage return, 0x0D) as a special character. When it encounters:

```
/curl|...|acunetix/i {\r\n
```

The parser sees:
- `/curl|...|acunetix/` (regex pattern)
- `i` (unexpected character instead of expected `/i`)
- ` ` (space)
- `{` (opening brace)
- `\r` (carriage return - confuses parser)
- `\n` (line feed)

The `\r` causes the parser to stop reading the line prematurely, making it appear that the regex is incomplete (missing `/i {`).

### Why Multiple sed Stages

Running `sed 's/\r$//'` at multiple stages ensures:
1. **Idempotency**: Running multiple times is safe (sed on LF file = LF file)
2. **Defense**: Catches CRLF no matter where it's introduced
3. **Visibility**: Diagnostic output confirms success at each stage
